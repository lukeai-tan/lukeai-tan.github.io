# MHW Crown Checklist

## Overview:
Monster Hunter World Crown Checklist to help players easily track their crown progress

## Description
The website offers two distinct checklists: one for base game monsters and one for Iceborne monsters. To keep the layout clean, I implemented collapsible tables for both the base game and Iceborne checklists, allowing you to hide sections you are done with or don’t need. Each monster's name, type (Base or Iceborne), and crown categories (giant and miniature) are displayed, with checkboxes for tracking your progress.

## Local Storage
Under each monster, you’ll find checkboxes for the Giant and Miniature crowns. You can check the boxes based on the crowns you've obtained in-game. The checklist remembers your selections and saves it locally, meaning your progress is saved even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
