# MHW Crown Checklist

#### Overview:
I created the Monster Hunter World Crown Checklist to help players easily track their progress in obtaining crowns for monsters in the game. 

# Features
The website offers two distinct checklists: one for base game monsters and one for Iceborne monsters. I separated these two to avoid creating an overwhelming list and to ensure that players without the Iceborne DLC can focus solely on the base game. To keep the layout clean, I implemented collapsible tables for both the base game and Iceborne checklists, allowing users to hide sections they don’t need. Each monster's name, type (Base or Iceborne), and crown categories (giant and miniature) are displayed, with checkboxes for tracking your progress.

## Local Storage
Under each monster, you’ll find checkboxes for the Giant and Miniature crowns. You can check the boxes based on the crowns you've obtained in-game. The checklist remembers your selections and saves it locally, meaning your progress is saved even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
